<p>This was an excercise to test ChatGPT's ability to write code. I did not write a single line of code, just told ChatGPT what add or fix iteratively</p>

<p>Started with "GPT-4o", which was fun, until it started to go around in circles, fixing some things and breaking others. It was very useful to work with "canvas" to run the html code and see the changes/errors, but at some point didn't work anymore</p>
<p>Finally, copied a working copy of the code into a "o3-mini-high" model which performed slowly, but was really accurate while working on the fixes/features.</p>
