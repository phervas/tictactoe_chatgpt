Made this excercise to test ChatGPT's ability to write code.
Started with ChatGPT 4o, until it started to go around in circles, fixing some things and breaking others. It was very useful to work with "canvas" to run the html code and see the changes/errors.
Finally, copied a working copy of the code into a "3o Mini High" model which performed really well.
